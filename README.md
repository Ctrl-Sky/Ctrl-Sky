Hi, welcome to my GitHub.

I am a level 1 Computer Science student studying at McMaster who loves logic, math, and the perfect combination of those two, coding.

I currently have one project completed which is a my attempt at coding pong on pygame. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to start any new projects ever since school started, but school has taught me many new things about computer science and I am excited to apply what I have learned on my next project!
