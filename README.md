Hi, welcome to my GitHub.

I am a level 1 Computer Science student studying at McMaster who loves logic, math, and the perfect combination of those two, coding.

I currently have one project completed which is a my attempt at coding pong on pygame. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to start any new projects ever since school started, but I am excited to apply my new found knowledge around computer science to create a new and exciting project when I have more free time!
